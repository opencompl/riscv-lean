# riscv-lean

Hand-polished, bitblastable semantics for RISC-V (RV64) in Lean 4, proven equivalent to the auto-generated authoritative semantics of the [Sail RISC-V model](https://github.com/opencompl/sail-riscv-lean).

## Building

### Prerequisites

- [Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/)
- [Lake](https://github.com/leanprover/lake) (Lean's build system, bundled with Lean)

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/opencompl/riscv-lean.git
cd riscv-lean

# Build the project
lake build
```

## Usage

Add `riscv-lean` as a dependency in your `lakefile.toml`:

```toml
[[require]]
name = "SailRV64"
git = "https://github.com/opencompl/riscv-lean"
rev = "main"
```

Then import the library in your Lean files:

```lean
import RISCV
```
